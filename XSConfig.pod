=head1 NAME

XSConfig - Fast XS drop-in replacement for Config.pm with perfect hashing.

=head1 VERSION

Version 6.00_08

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Config.pm included by default with Perl is pure Perl.  Nearly all Perl apps
will load Config.pm.  For a number of reasons, of speed and memory space,
reimplement the P5P shipped Config.pm as an XS library, shareable between
processes as read-only memory, and with a hash that is better optimized than
Perl hashes, courtesy of gperf tool which generates collision-free perfect
hashes.

This module is a drop-in replacement for Config.pm. All code that does

    use Config;

will use the XS implementation after installing this module.  To revert to the
original pure perl Config.pm, go and delete the following 3 files that will be
next to each other in /site, Config.pm, Config_mini.pl, Config_xs_heavy.pl, and
the Config shared library in /auto, after deleting the /site files, the original
pure perl Config.pm in /lib will be loaded.

Since XS Config is a compiled C shared library, it can not be edited with a text
editor after it is built.  To change the values in the XS Config module,
edit the pure perl Config_heavy.pl file with a text editor and rebuild XS
Config.

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU HAVE GPERF TOOL INSTALLED AND RUNNABLE FROM
YOUR PATH BEFORE INSTALLING XS CONFIG.
