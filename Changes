        -more common keys for cperl and CPAN Testers

6.24    Thu, Jun 07, 2018  2:56:27 PM
        -more common keys for CPAN Testers
        -soft delete keys in the pre-generated fallback hash for systems without

          -fixed cast to pointer not allowed (C++ build)
          -changed rurban email address
          -patch Config_lookup()'s prototype for key len to be 32 bits as
           before because gperf 3.1 changed it to 64 bit key length
           See cperl#286

         Portable.pm
