=head1 NAME

XSConfig - Fast XS drop-in replacement for Config.pm with perfect hashing.

=head1 VERSION

Version 6.00_04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Config.pm included by default with Perl is pure Perl.  Nearly all Perl apps
will load Config.pm.  For a number of reasons, of speed and memory space,
reimplement the P5P shipped Config.pm as an XS library, shareable between
processes as read-only memory, and with a hash that is better optimized than
Perl hashes, courtesy of gperf tool which generates collision-free perfect
hashes.
 
This module is a drop-in replacement for Config.pm. All code that does
 
    use Config;
 
will use the XS implementation after installing this module.  To revert to the
original pure perl Config.pm, go and delete the following 3 files that will be
next to each other in /site, Config.pm, Config_mini.pl, Config_xs_heavy.pl, and
the Config shared library in /auto, after deleting the /site files, the original
pure perl Config.pm in /lib will be loaded.
 
IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU HAVE GPERF TOOL INSTALLED AND RUNNABLE FROM
YOUR PATH BEFORE INSTALLING XS CONFIG.
